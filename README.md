# InvestingADataset
In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

For completion of this project, I do the following steps:

1. I have posed questions that can be answered with the given dataset and then answering those questions
2. Then I start with the data wrangling and do any necessary clean up on the data
3. I continue by stating the limitations on the data 
4. And then include some statistical inference and calculations on the correlation of different categories in the data
5. Finally, I communicate my results

Skills:
- Vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas 
- Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects
- Matplotlib to produce plots showing the findings
